\e[1mAUTOKNIGHT\e[0m - Fleet management

Welcome to Autoknight! Inspired by both Coinmaster (finance) and Taskwarrior (tasks). Similarly to the latter two, Autoknight is
a manager for all things concerning vehicular data. Useful to speed up tax returns on March or to simply view a financial report
or to view pending tasks, expired documents, etc.

SYNOPSIS
    autoknight [command] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
    A future fleet management tool inspired by:
    - Coinmaster (financial tracking)
    - Taskwarrior (task management)
    
    Currently a proof-of-concept demonstrating intended functionality for vehicle data management.

Per autoknight's definition, a vehicle has many properties which may be grouped in 8 categories:

VEHICLE PROPERTIES (8 Categories)
1. \e[1mIdentification\e[0m
   - VIN, ownership history, purchase details
   - Static reference data (entered once)

2. \e[1mDocumentation\e[0m
   - Registration, insurance, inspections
   - Legal compliance tracking

3. \e[1mMileage\e[0m
   - Odometer readings with timestamps
   - Tax-deductible travel tracking

4. \e[1mFuelling\e[0m
   - Fuel purchases and consumption
   - Cost-per-mile calculations (future)

5. \e[1mMaintenance\e[0m
   - Service records and repair history
   - Scheduled maintenance tracking

6. \e[1mSupplies\e[0m
   - Parts and consumables inventory
   - Expense categorization

7. \e[1mTasks\e[0m
