\e[1mAUTOKNIGHT\e[0m — Fleet Management Utility

Welcome to Autoknight — a utility crafted to consolidate and simplify your vehicular data management. Inspired by Coinmaster’s financial oversight and Taskwarrior’s task-driven rigor, Autoknight offers a unified platform for recording, reviewing, and acting upon every facet of your fleet.

Whether assembling precise tax documentation, tracking fuel and maintenance expenses, monitoring upcoming renewals, or auditing expired credentials, Autoknight minimizes friction by uniting all records under a single, coherent interface.

Per Autoknight’s design, each vehicle’s data is organized into eight principal categories:

VEHICLE PROPERTIES (8 Categories)
1. \e[1mIdentification\e[0m  
   VIN, ownership history, purchase cost and date  
   (static reference data; entered once)

2. \e[1mDocumentation\e[0m  
   Registration, insurance, inspection certificates  
   (expiry tracking; compliance monitoring)

3. \e[1mMileage\e[0m  
   Odometer readings with date–time stamps  
   (journey logs; tax‑deductible travel)

4. \e[1mFuelling\e[0m  
   Fuel purchase records and fill‑up details  
   (consumption metrics; cost‑per‑mile analysis)

5. \e[1mMaintenance\e[0m  
   Service entries, repair invoices, warranty notes  
   (scheduled servicing; repair history)

6. \e[1mSupplies\e[0m  
   Parts, consumables, and inventory counts  
   (stock levels; expense categorization)

7. \e[1mTasks\e[0m  
   Pending actions (e.g., “Renew registration”)  
   (deadlines; status reminders)

8. \e[1mJournal\e[0m  
   Free‑form notes on performance, issues, or observations  
   (usage insights; planning reference)

2. Financial calculations are illustrative; accuracy will improve with future updates.  
3. Persistent storage and synchronization features are planned but not yet implemented.
